		    * required

Inside the templates directory, you must have three files:
index.tpl   - index.html template
archive.tpl - used for monthly indexes
rss.tpl     - generates rss feed

The tar ball, and svn, includes the templates I use for my site (http://proudestfather.inarow.net/)

This will create the HTML files for your blog, in the path-to-published-site 
directory.  It will not touch any other files, so you can include other content
in the target path (CSS, images, other pages, etc).

To populate the site, you send email to your autoblogger email address.  This
should be an address you set up just for this purpose.  The emails you send
should include one photo.  The subject will become the title of the blog post,
the body will be the blog content, and the image will be... the image!  If you
start your body with a line such as:

>date: 2005-12-25

You can fudge the date of your posts.

Good luck.
